Modified user_interface.cpp to fit the 16x2 LCD display as original file is for a 20x4 LCD Display. Orignal file displayed:

Temperature:__'C
Gas:____________
Alarm:___

Where the blank space after temperature shows temperature reading from temperature sensor, blank space after Gas shows either Not Detected or Detected, and the blank space after Alarm displays either ON or OFF.

From original file, changed the LCD display to show:

TMP:__'C GAS:__
ALARM:___

Where the blank space after TMP shows temperature reading from temperature sensor, blank space after Gas shows either ND or D, and the blank space after Alarm displays either ON or OFF.
